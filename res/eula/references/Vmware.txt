9.     strong>SOFTWARE PRODUCT SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS

In addition to the above, the following Software products shall also be subject to the following terms and conditions set forth below.  In the event of any conflict between the following product-specific terms and conditions and the preceding sections, the product-specific terms and conditions shall control.

 

9.1     ESX:

(a)  Additional Definitions:

‘Blade Server"  means a specific type of Server manufactured for and packaged within a modular chassis hardware with shared internal backplane, power supplies, cooling and connectivity infrastructure, and described by the vendor as implementing a blade server architecture.

"Installed Server" means a Server with the Software installed that has the capability to boot up ESX or ESXi. The installation of the Software can be on an internal or external dedicated disk, a Fibre Channel or iSCSI LUN, an NFS or SMB share, a USB key, PXE server, firmware, or any other bootable media.  If a Server has connectivity to a bootable media containing ESX or ESXi, even if it also has the capability of booting non-ESX or non-ESXi server images, it shall be considered an Installed Server for the purposes of this EULA. 

"VMware Virtual Infrastructure Client Software" is a proprietary client component of the Software that provides the user interface and enables management of the Software.

"VMware WebAccess" is a proprietary component that provides console access to and management of Virtual Machines created with the Software.

"Web Service Interface" means a programmatic interface to perform management operations on Servers that are activated for management by the VirtualCenter Server Software through software programs written by you or a third party.

(b)  Additional License Terms:

VMware grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable license, without rights to sublicense, to (i) install or have installed a single instance of the Software and each Licensed Additional Module on a single Server, unless permitted to have multiple instances on a single Server or to have multiple instances on multiple Servers by the payment of applicable license fees (whether such fees are based on a per Processor, a per Virtual Machine, a per user or any other VMware approved licensing model); (ii) use the Software and each Licensed Additional Module solely for information processing and computing purposes, including the hosting of computer application-based services from a Virtual Machine and provision of such services via an internal or external network, provided such services may not consist of services to a third party that provide primarily computing or processing power (such as utility computing or grid computing) or any computer application-based service that is traded, rented, leased or sold on a Virtual Machine basis; and (iii) use and reproduce the VMware Virtual Infrastructure Client Software or VMware WebAccess (in object code form only) for the purposes of installation and operation on an unlimited number of your own internal computers or terminals solely for the purpose of accessing the Server on which the Software is installed.

Notwithstanding the above, at all times you shall have a valid license for each instance of the Software on any Installed Server regardless of its power state or purpose.  For clarification, this includes any and all Servers that may only be temporarily installed with the Software for disaster recovery readiness testing, in the case of an actual disaster or data center migration. Copies of the Software boot media that are made for backup or disaster recovery purposes do not require separate licenses so long as they are not associated with a Server in a way that allows that Server to boot ESX or ESXi from that image; however when such a bootable association is made, said Server constitutes an Installed Server which would require a valid license for the Software. 

Blade server license limitation.  You may license this software package as part of a license pack or bundle (a "Blade Server License Pack") for installation and operation on a Blade Server.  If you acquired the Software as part of a Blade Server License Pack, you may only install and operate the Server Software on a Blade Server and you may not transfer, install or use the Server Software on Servers in a rack-mounted server configuration or on any other Servers.  In addition, a Blade Server License Pack must be installed and operated on blades that are plugged into a single chassis.

(c) VMware View  

In the event that you have licensed VMware View, which consists of VMware Infrastructure (ESX and VirtualCenter), with any of the following components: View Manager, View Composer, ThinApp or another Connection Broker , based on a number of concurrent Powered On Desktop Virtual Machine(s), the following definitions and license terms apply. 


Additional Definitions:

"Client" is a device which is used to interact and connect to a hosted Desktop Virtual Machine.

"Connection Broker" is a device which (a) accepts incoming connection requests from the Client(s); (b) locates an available hosted Desktop Virtual Machine; and (c) brokers the connection between the Client and the available hosted Desktop Virtual Machine.

"Desktop Virtual Machine" is a hosted Virtual Machine with one of the following operating systems: Windows 95/98, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows Vista Business, or Windows Vista Enterprise.

"Powered On" means a Desktop Virtual Machine which is receiving remote connections from a Client.

Additional License Terms:

VMware grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable license, without rights to sublicense, to (i) install the Software for the purpose of hosting Desktop Virtual Machines on a Server (ii) use the Software to connect to a hosted Desktop Virtual Machine from any devices provided that the total number of Desktop Virtual Machines which are Powered On, does not exceed the number of Desktop Virtual Machines for which you have paid the applicable license fee, each of which is running a validly licensed copy of the operating system for which the Software is designed as specified in the definition of Desktop Virtual Machine; and (iii) use the Software solely for your own internal information processing services and computing needs.


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that you have licensed VMware View which consists of VMware Infrastructure with any of the following components: vCenter Server, View Manager, View Composer, ThinApp or another Connection Broker, VMware licenses ESX to you solely for hosting Desktop Virtual Machine(s), except you may run View Manager itself, vCenter Server, another Connection Broker and/or any management and performance monitoring tools used solely for ESX-hosted Desktop Virtual Machine(s) within an operating system of a Server.
