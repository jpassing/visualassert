VisualAssert
============

Visual Assert is a Visual Studio® AddIn that allows you to easily write, manage, run, and debug your C/C++ unit tests – without ever leaving the Visual Studio® IDE. No fiddling with command line tools, no complex configuration, and no boilerplate code required. 

Visual Assert (formerly code-named cfix studio) is based on, and fully compatible to the open source unit testing framework cfix.
